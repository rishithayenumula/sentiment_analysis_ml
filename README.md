# Sentiment Analysis on Text Data

## Overview
This project implements a beginner-friendly sentiment analysis system using Python and classical machine learning techniques.
The objective is to classify text reviews as **positive** or **negative** and understand the end-to-end machine learning workflow.

This project is designed for learning purposes and focuses on implementation clarity rather than achieving high accuracy.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy

## Project Workflow
1. Load and explore the dataset  
2. Perform text preprocessing (cleaning and vectorization)  
3. Train supervised machine learning models  
4. Evaluate and compare model performance  

## Models Implemented
- Logistic Regression  
- Multinomial Naive Bayes  

## Dataset
A small labeled text dataset containing positive and negative reviews is used.

> Note: The dataset size is intentionally kept small for learning purposes, so evaluation metrics may vary and are used here to demonstrate model behavior rather than optimize accuracy.

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository  
git clone https://github.com/rishithayenumula/sentiment-analysis-ml.git
2. Navigate to the project folder  
cd sentiment-analysis-ml
3. Install dependencies  
pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Run the Jupyter Notebook  
jupyter notebook
5. Open `sentiment_analysis.ipynb` and run all cells.

## Results
Both models are evaluated using accuracy and confusion matrix.
A comparison is performed to understand how different classifiers behave on text data.

## Learning Outcomes
- Text preprocessing and feature extraction  
- Supervised machine learning concepts  
- Model evaluation and comparison  
- End-to-end ML workflow implementation
